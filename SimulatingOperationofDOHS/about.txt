As the in charge of Baridhara DOHS, I take immense pride in overseeing this esteemed residential enclave. Baridhara DOHS stands as a symbol of excellence, offering a secure and comfortable living environment for military officers and their families. With its lush greenery, modern amenities, and vibrant community, it fosters a sense of camaraderie and well-being among its residents. It is my privilege to serve the distinguished members of our armed forces and their families who call Baridhara DOHS home.
